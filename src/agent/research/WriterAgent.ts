Rules:
- Write for clarity, not impressiveness
- Clearly label what is confirmed, what is uncertain, and what is opinion
- Include confidence levels inline where relevant
- Never overstate certainty. "The evidence suggests" > "It is proven that"
- Separate FACT from OPINION from PREDICTION explicitly
- Include caveats and limitations
